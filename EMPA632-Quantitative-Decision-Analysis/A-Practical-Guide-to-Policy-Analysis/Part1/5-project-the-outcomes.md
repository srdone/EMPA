#Project the outcomes

3 difficulties:
 - uncertainty about the future
 - difficulty being realistic about all the effects it will have
 - can fall into the trap of defending something as if we had more confidence
   in it than we do

####Combine models and evidence
 - cannot always be as rigorous as social science
 - focus on whether reliance on a model leads to better results than guesswork
 - cannot ignore any facets of prolems as social science models, by nature, do
 - use multiple models when they can help understand the problem
 - pay attention to existing conditions

####Choose a base case to compare against
 - compare alternatives against this case
 - this is often the condition that exists today
 - some examples:
    - future conditions if no policy change is made
    - changes that would occur if a policy were adopted

####Direction and Magnitude
 - stating magnitude prevents misinterpretation
 - sometimes provide a range

####Pay attention to trends
 - incorporate knowledge about how future changes will affect current trends
 - possible things that will affect the trend:
    - seasonal variation
    - cyclical variation
    - changing regulations
    - changing demographics

####Shrink uncertainty with threshold analysis
 - policy change recommendations must carry some justification
 - find the minimum level of acceptable effectiveness given the costs
 - ask what changes would produce the minimum level of effectiveness
 - figure out the likelihood that the changes will result in the required level of effectiveness
 - estimate the probability of failure and what costs are associated with it

Example of break-even (threshold) analysis:
> Building a new stadium for the Hometown Heroes looks like a good idea,
> given the nature of the costs and benefits, if average daily attendance
> turns out to be no less than 10,000. That’s the break-even attendanc
> figure for you and the relevant decision makers. It’s up to them to
> decide, first, how confident they are that this break-even level
> will be reached and, then, whether that degree of confidence is
> enough to warrant making an affirmative decision. You can thus
> organize your presentation of facts and opinions to focus
> on these two key issues.

####Sensitivity Analysis
 - Identify the uncertainties that matter most to sticking with the decision
 - What small changes might cause a change in your decision?
 - Assess assumptions for how critical they are to the analysis
 - Use Monte Carlo simulation to model changes in assumptions and quantify
   their effect on the final policy choice.
 - look to minimize regret for the decision based on uncertainty

####Confront optimism
 - avoid excessive optimism
 - think about possibilites that may cause the policy to fail
 - consider ways it may fail in implemetation:
   - impacts of electoral change
   - 'piling on', expanding the mandate of a program
   - fraud and waste
 - include these possibilities in the analysis document
 - consider negative consequences / adverse side effects

####Emergent features problem
 - actors adapt and get around policy
 - think about how you would act if you were in a position to be affected
   by the policy

####Outcomes matrix
 - helps in the beginning to understand the problem
 - presented more formally in the final analysis
 - rows are the policy alternatives
 - columns are the evaluative criteria
 - cells are the projected outcome for that alternative / criteria combination
 - can be made in reference to the base condition
 - simplify it by combining variants of base alternatives, getting rid of
   obvious losers, removing criteria that are similar across alternatives
 - put more important criteria to the left
 - determine the appropriate / easiest to use scale
 - easy to understand labels
 - group into policy contexts
