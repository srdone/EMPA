#Step 1 - Define the problem

Why define the problem?
 - gives you a reason for doing the work
 - gives a sense of direction for evidence gathering
 - help you structure how to tell the story

####Think of Deficit and Excess
> e.g.: “California’s population of school-aged children is
> growing by 140,000 per year, and our ability to develop the
> physical facilities in which to educate them is not growing
> nearly as fast.”

####What troubles are worth our time in public policy?
Does it really constitute a problem?

> "What private troubles warrant definition as public problems
> and thereby legitimately raise claims for amelioration by
> public resources"?

For example, market failure cases:
 - difficult to collect payment from all who benefit 
 - difficult to collect the full economic cost from all who benefit 

Other cases:
 - breakdown of systems, such as the family
 - discrimination
 - difficulty aquiring marketable skills

Government failure:
 - majority imposing high costs on minority
 - outsized influcence of organized groups
 - government inefficiencies and inflexibilities

####Be careful with issue rhetoric
 - Don't take rhetoric at face value
 - explore the philosophical and empirical grounds on whether something
   should be considered 'bad'
 - it often has a partisan or ideological flavor
 - don't echo the rhetoric, but use it as raw material in your problem definition

####Policy analysis is necessary because of uncertainty
We answer questions about the future to reduce uncertainty

####Quantification important
 - Find a metric that can be used to quantify the problem
 - How big is too big? How small is too small? too slow/fast?
 - Provide point estimates and a range of possibilities

####Figure out which conditions cause problems
 - this helps answer the why of government involvement
 - What we sometimes think is causing the problem is not
 - We have to figure out what changes will actually improve the problems
   we are trying to solve - not just pay attention to what seems obvious

####Figure out the odds
 - it is important to know how likely our recommendations are to have an effect
 - a recommendation that is very likely to produce a small change
   may be better than a change that is somewhat likely to produce a large change

####Look for hidden/neglected opportunities
 - rise above merely patching and fixing
 - examples:
   - architecture of choice
   - social norms marketing
   - reduce market failure by finding ways to internalize costs
   - improving operations strategies
   - cost based pricing
   - finding ways to accomplish two things with one action
   - etc...

####Avoid common pitfalls:
 - problem definition should not include an implicit solution
    - the definition can prevent thinking out of the box
    - e.g.: "Too little shelter for homeless families" implies we need to build more
      shelters, which may prevent us from thinking about how to prevent homelessness
      in the first place - instead: "Too many families are homeless"
 - accepting too easily implied cause

####Iterate
 - your understanding of the problem evovles as you explore the data
 - don't be afraid to change your problem definition as your understanding evolves
