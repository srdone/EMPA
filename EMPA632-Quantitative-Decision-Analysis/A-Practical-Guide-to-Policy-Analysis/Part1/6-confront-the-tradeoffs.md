#Confront the tradeoffs

####Focus on outcomes
 - though each alternative has different features, it is the outcomes that matter
 - e.g. - not where police officers are allocated, but resultig crime rates
 - helps to set priorities if multiple alternatives are chosen

####Weight the criteria
 - can use money for a way to compare metrics
 - 'money' defined by 'willingness-to-pay'
 - ask 'is a randomly terminated life worth at least XX dollars'
 - because policy decisions may result in changes in lives lost,
   you implicitly are deciding how much a life is worth

####Frame the tradeoffs clearly
 - speak in terms of averages / percentages
 - remember that some individuals experience more effects of policies
   than others

####Express tradeoffs as increments
 - relative to base outcomes
 - can express as X dollars for extra service Y results in Z units of good outcome

####Rank order tradeoffs that can't qe quantified
 - helps decision makers understand which order to do things in
