#Select the criteria

Policies involve:
 - facts, projections
 - value judgements

####'Evaluative' criteria
 - based on values
 - not used to judge alternatives, but to judge outcomes

####Common Evaluative criteria
 - hitting a specific target
 - efficiency / cost-effectiveness
 - benefit / cost analysis
 - equality, equity, fairness, justice
 - freedom, community, and related ideas
 - amount of say the public has in the decision

####How criteria are weighed
 - through the political process
 - by the anaylyst due to their experience and understanding of the problem
   - important to correct imbalances the political process introduces
   - e.g. - paying attention to equity and efficiency
 - according to rights (property, privacy, civil, etc.)

####Common Practical Criteria
 - legality
   - is it legal? does it impose on legal right?
 - political acceptability
   - is there too much political opposition for this solution?
   - is there not enough political support for this solution?
   - policies that have large effects on small groups will mobilize those groups.
 - administrative robustness and improvability
   - can the current structure of administrative systems implement the policy?
   - will it be implemented as envisioned?
   - what aspects of the bureaucracy will get in the way?
 - policy sustainability
   - will the next group of elected officials continue to support the policy?
   - signals of risk:
     - lack of bipartisan support
     - effects too invisible to continue to mobilize supporters
     - capture of benefits by an unintended group

####Additional tips
 - Single criteria can be more clearly thought about - multiple criteria may require quantitative decision analysis tools
 - group criteria into positive / negative categories
 - be clear about harsh realities
 - quantify metrics where possible
 - don't confuse alternatives with criteria
    - e.g.: rapid-response hotline - 'rapid-response' is criteria, hotline is an alternative
