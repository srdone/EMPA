#Construct alternatives / list of all options

####Alternatives are not mutually exclusive
 - one solution doesn't always preclude another solution

####Be comprehensive
 - list all possible alternatives at first
 - near the end stage, reduce to two or three options
 - come up with creative solutions
 - don't tie yourself to convention
 - include the current state of the world as a possible option

####Brainstorm / be creative
 - how would you solve it if cost were no object?
 - think about all the places a particular solution could apply
 - ask why not
 - can current trends take care of the issue without intervention?
 - ask whether you need to learn more about the problem

####Understand how the system works
 - better understanding of how a system works makes it easier to see solutions
 - use a model to understand the system
    - ignore / set aside irrelevant and complicating aspects
 - think about demand and supply in a wider context
    - e.g.: supply vs demand of state hospital beds
 - how are results shaped by social norms?
    - e.g.: ads against a 'bad' behavior may reinforce the idea that it is prevalent

##Types of models
 - Market - not limited to supply and demand of a commodity
    - e.g. - supply vs demand of state hospital beds / homeless shelter beds
 - Production - how non-market production works and what pitfalls exist
 - Conformity - how people adopt the attitudes and actions of those around them
 - Evolutionary - how things change over time

####Simplify your list of alternatives
 - summarize the strategy of an alternative
 - make it easy to see similarities / differences in each alternative
 - distinguish between the basic strategy and its variants
   - strategy vs implementation details

####Allow for phased-in approaches
