#Assemble some evidence

*Be careful with bias:*
 - created by lack of time
 - created by political motivations
 - key is to focus on evidence

####Three purposes for evidence:
 - assess the nature and extent of the problem
 - assess the features of the policy proposal
    - e.g.:
      - workloads
      - budget figures
      - demographic changes
 - figure out what other policies have been effective in similar circumstances

##Think before you collect

*The kind of evidence you collect matters more than the quantity*

####The value of evidence
 - will it be likely to show you better options

####Estimates and guesses
 - gathering evidence is only necessary when the decision important enough to require it
 - help to avoid collecting useless data
 - ask yourself:
    - what implications would a certain result have?
    - How different would my decision look if I actually took
      the time to gather more data and the results were similar to my best guess?
    - how much is it worth to spend the time to find out the difference between
      my guess and the real data?

####Review available literature
 - pay attention to the quality of the studies
   - look at strengths and limitations of the research design
   - how relevant is it to the problem at hand
   - who paid for the work?

####Look for past solutions to similar and seemingly dissimilar problems
 - see what has worked in the private sector that will work in the public sector
 - look across industries / specialties / problem categories

##Keys for successful evidence gathering
 - start early
 - involve all stakeholders early in the process
 - share preliminary results, obtain feedback
 - involve all interested parties from all sides of an issue
