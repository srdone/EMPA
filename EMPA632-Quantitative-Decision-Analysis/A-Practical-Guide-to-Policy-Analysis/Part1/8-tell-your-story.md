#Step 8: tell your story

####The Grandma Bessie test
 - one minute to explain, in coherent, easy to understand language, 
   the problem and the solution
 - recognize that even if you don't have to explain it to someone
   who has a hard time understanding, someone will

####Gauge your audiences
 - whose approval do you need most?
 - what is your relationship with that person/group?
 - how easy will it be to correct misunderstanding?
 - what is the political environment like?
 - how will your results be picked up in the media?
 - how will your statistics be understood?
 - what is the best medium for communicating the analysis given the audience?

####Watch out for:
 - scare words
 - the temptation to rely on statistics alone
 - longwindedness

####Make sure to:
 - put a human face on the problem
 - show how your solution could make life better for real people
 - preemptively raise and rebut possible objections
 - use clear headings, subheadings, and visual aids
 - practice oral presentations
 - use a logical, well organized narrative flow

####Oral presentations
 - speak slowly and distinctly
 - speak loudly enough to be heard everywhere in the room
 - speak in a lower register
 - don't fidget
 - make lots of eye contact with audience members

####Narrative flow
 - make it evident what motivates the entire analysis
 - avoid lengthy digressions
 - make it clear how the effects will come about
 - possibly start with a recommendation and show how it is justified
 - start with idealized, stylized examples and add detail on as you go

####Pitfalls
 - following the eightfold path too closely
   - use it to think through the problem, not tell the story
 - interrupting argument flow with qualifying statments
   - use 'most', 'on average', 'more often than not' to avoid digression
 - showing all your work
   - focus on what is really important and relevant to the final analysis
 - listing without explaining
   - don't waste the reader's/listener's energy with alternatives that are
     will be dismissed, especially when there are many
 - spinning a 'mystery yarn'
   - be upfront with the conclusion, then provide detail - don't lead
     the reader down a blind path
 - inflating the style
   - use common, but not chatty, language
 - forgetting that analysis doesn't persuade, analysts do
   - the quality of public speaking matters
   - be professional in manner, presentation, dress, etc.
   - remember that the costs of disorganization can last a long time

####Structure
 - begin with an executive summary
 - if longer than 20 pages, use a table of contents
 - in the table of contents, list tables and figures
 - use headings and subheadings

####Tables
 - number and title the tables with relevant titles
 - include the main point to be learned in the title
 - when showing causal relationships, focus in on a single point that
   explains the issue
 - make it easy to see the point of the table without the need
   for a lot of math or footnotes
 - don't imitate scientific practice with tables - tell a story with the
   tables, detailed tables can be in appendices.
 - minimize the information in tables

####Statistics
 - keep them few and simple
 - use metrics meaningful to your audience (e.g. english units)

####References and sources
 - use author's last name and the year inline in the text, with a references
   section at the end
 - favor footnotes over endnotes

####Format
 - when delivered as a memo, use a standard memo format
 - develop a press release

####On PowerPoint Slides:
 - keep it simple
 - make it legible: color, distance
 - avoid informal, 'cutesy' style
 - allow enough time for slide to be read
 - include summarization / heading slides
 - provide slides afterward
 - carefully choose photographs / supplements
