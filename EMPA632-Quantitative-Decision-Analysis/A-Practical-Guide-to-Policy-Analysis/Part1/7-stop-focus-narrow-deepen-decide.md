#Step 7: Stop, focus, narrow, deepen, decide

Your analysis should ensure that at least one of 
the alternatives would be an excellent choice
to take aim at solving or mitigating the problem

Focus on:
 - politics of getting the alternative adopted
 - design of the institutional features required

As a check, make a decision based on your analysis

If you can't see a clear decision:
 - clarify tradeoffs
 - think about probability of serious implementation problems
 - clarify crucial cost estimates
 - if you can't be convinced, neither will your stakeholders

####ASK:
*If your favorite policy alternative is so great, why
isn't it happening already?*
 - resistance of stakeholders?
 - lack of an 'entrepreneur' in the area?
