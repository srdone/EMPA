##Decision Matrix

What things to think about when we get 5 offers for internships:

   - pay
   - people working with
   - impact on community
   - etc
 - put weights on each category


####Decision matrix

 - 1-9 Scale
 - Put everything on a common scale
 - Add items up
 - Criteria not as important as others - put weights on them
   - weights are subjective
   - Must be easy to interpret - use whole numbers
   - least important is 1, everything else increment from there
   - =SUMPRODUCT
 - if numbers are the same, you should be indifferent
 - % of best: =val/max(values)
 - Rank: =rank(val, values)
