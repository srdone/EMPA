Challenging Stack Ranking and 'The War for Talent' - not best performers needed, best teams needed
Even the 'smartest' need to know how to work with others to be effective

 - high social sensitivity
 - take turns when speaking
 - number of women in group matters
 - eye contact
 - facing each other
 - work individually assessed may hinder performance
