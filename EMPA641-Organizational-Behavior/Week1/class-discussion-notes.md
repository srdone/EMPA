Some things will be easy for me, others will be hard.

 - talking about people and not problems

Good meetings:
 - truth telling

 - 'Every meeting should be a revelatory experience' - Elder Bednar
 - Revelation implies action
 - A good meeting is your PAL:
   - Purpose
   - Accountability
   - Limits

Handbook of instructions the best OB text

A good meeting is your PAL:
 - Purpose:
   - cancel meeting if you don't know why you are holding it
   - have a justification for taking time
   - Have 1-2 purposes (easy win)
   - Achievable by end of meeting
   - Purpose should not be 'to discuss' (how do you know when you've accomplished it?)
 - Accountability
   - "Act and not be acted upon"
   - Begins with agenda
   - Lets everyone be responsible for accomplishing purpose
   - Have an agenda for each team meeting
   - When we hold people accountable they step up (that's what the gospel says)
 - Limits
   - Times on items
   - Helps people not be anxious about when the meeting will end
   - Provides a sense of urgency
   - Should have start and end times
   - Reschedule when in danger of violating limits

Look for opportunities to influence the process if you are not the one in charge.

Good Agendas:
 - Write in 2-3 minutes
 - Include past assignments: 'return and report'
 - Circulate in advance
 - Time for each element

 - a 'constitution'
 - consensus

 - Norms/rules
   - expectations for one another
   - strive for detail
   - formalize leadership roles (consider)
 - Conditions of team membership
   - precise consequences
   - due process critical
 - A living document
   - review regularly
   - revise as necessary
 - Draft due in 2 weeks

###Reading Discussion

####We need good teams

Dreamteam is mythology, collective intelligence is better

Three things for well-functioning teams:
 - Social sensitivity
 - Taking turns talking
 - Women
   - maybe in part because they are better at social sensitivity
   - Diversity hurts performance if there is no social sensitivity

####From Wharton to war

> "Two sheets and a blanket"

Key elements:
 - no one succeeds until everyone succeeds
 - not about equal work
 - means you don't have to be perfect
 - teams collaborate and are synergistic

Main points:
 - Two sheets and a blanket
   - help the team succeed
 - Carrying the pole
   - sometimes some team members need to take up slack when other team members can't do something
   - Those not 'carrying the pole' should stay engaged
 - Buddy teams
   - put two or three on a project

> 'Strengthen thy brethren'
