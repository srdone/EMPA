#Influence

##Transforming power into influence
 - influence is getting others to consent to help you accomplish something
 - retribution, reciprocity, reason

#####Retribution
 - personal threat, usually from formal authority
 - direct form is coercion
 - denial of rewards or giving punishment
 - intimidation - threat is only implied
 - peer pressure (e.g. stress need for harmony, mutual support)
 - exploit subordinate's desire to avoid unpleasantness
 - ignores rights and fairness

#####Reciprocity
 - satisfying self interest of both parties
 - bargaining (each party gains something)
 - ingratiation (favors to incur social obligations)
 - make outcomes desired by manager seem desireable and attractive
 - honors rights and fairness

#####Reason
 - argument that should do because of the inherent merits of the request
 - helping others to see why your ideas make sense
 - relies on facts/needs of case being compelling
 - appeal to personal values or goals
 - those who use this most are rated as highly effective by their bosses

#####Persuasion v Manipulation
 - persuasion is explicit
 - manipulation is deceptive and implicit

####Pros and Cons of Strategies

#####Retribution
 - pros
   - quick, direct action
   - work performed to manager's specifications
 - cons
   - engenders resistance
   - stifles initiative
 - when to use
   - sparingly
   - ongoing commitment is not critical
   - when surveillance possible

#####Reciprocity
 - pros
   - compliance without resentment
   - justification of request not necessary
 - cons
   - generates expectation that every assignment is negotiable
   - expectation of reward for every assignment
 - use when
   - established rules exist
   - some degree of trust
   - unambiguous assignments

#####Reason
 - pros
   - internalized commitment
   - decreased need for surveillance
 - cons
   - takes a long time to generate needed trust
   - difficult when there are dissimilar backgrounds
   - difficult when conflicting responsibilities, competing philosophies
 - use when
   - worst thing person can do is say no
   - high trust

> When we can help others understand the reasons, the likelihood
> they will comply willingly is higher.

#####Upward influence through Reason
 - issue selling - draw attention to issues or problems that concern you
 - provide information to bosses that lack it
 - speak up to lead up
 - team up
 - lead up, don't argue up

###Acting assertively

> It is important to be prepared to protect ourselves from unwanted,
> inappropriate efforts by others to influence our actions.

#####Neutralizing Retribution
 - shift focus to interdependence
 - focus on negative consequences of failing to respect rights
 - confront exploiter directly
 - actively resist (work slowdown, disobedience, reporting to higher manager)

#####Neutralizing Reciprocity
 - avoid being duped or manipulated
 - examine the intent of any gift or favor (ask questions or decline)
 - confront directly - draw attention to attempts at manipulation
 - refuse to bargain with those who use high-pressure tactics

#####Neutralizing Reason Strategies
 - explain adverse effects on performance
 - defend your personal rights
   - appeal to sense of fairness
 - firmly refuse to comply

> Ideally, one should become a strong person in a strong position

> The unbridled use of power tends to increase resistance ... which
> in turn erodes the ... power base

> "Far better to conceive of power as consisting in part of the 
> knowledge of when not to use all the power you have ... Whoever
> knows how to restrain and effectively release power finds ...
> that power flows back to him" -- A. Bartlett Giamatti
