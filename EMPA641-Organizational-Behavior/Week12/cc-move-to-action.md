#Move to Action

#####Two Traps:
 - violated expectations
 - inaction

####Decide how to decide
 - dialogue is not decision making
 - when authority line is clear - person in authority should make decision
 - when authority line is not clear
   - deciding how to decide can be quite difficult
   - part of the dialogue should be about how to decide
   - jointly decide how to decide

####Four methods
 - command
 - consult
 - vote
 - consensus

####How to choose

Ask yourself:
 - Who cares?
 - Who knows?
 - Who must agree?
 - How many people is it worth involving?

####Make Assignments

Four elements
 - Who?
 - Does what?
 - By when?
 - How will you follow up?

#####Who?
 - Make actual assignments so things actually get done
 - No 'we' when it comes to assignments

#####Does what?
 - Spell out exact deliverables
 - clarify up front to avoid wasted resources and hurt feelings
 - use contrasting - say what you do and don't want

#####By when?
 - Set clear goals for when things will be complete

> Goals without deadlines aren't goals; they're merely directions

#####How will you follow up?
 - progress checks along the way
 - build follow-up methods into the assignment
 - have milestones as part of the project

> if you want to hold people accountable, you must give
> them an opportunity to account.

####Document your owrk

> One dull pencil is worth six sharp minds
