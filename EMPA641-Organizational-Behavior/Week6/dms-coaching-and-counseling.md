#Coaching and Counseling

> Coaching focuses on abilities, counseling on attitudes

Important in:
 - rewarding positive performance
 - correcting problem behaviors or attitudes

Difficult when individuals:
 - not performing according to expectations
 - when attitudes are negative
 - when behavior is disruptive

What makes it difficult is doing it while avoiding alienation
or offending of others

Also required when others need:
 - advice
 - someone to listen to their problems
 - to register complaints

*Important to use the right skill - mismatch can make the problem worse*

###Coaching: ability problems

Involves:
 - passing along advice and information
 - setting standards for others
 - helping them learn how to do something better

Problems to use counseling for are caused by:
 - lack of ability
 - insufficient information or understanding
 - incompetence on the part of individuals

###Counseling: attitude problems

Involves:
 - helping others recognize that a problem exists
 - helping others see how important their attitude is
 - helping others identify ways to address the problem

Problems to use counseling for are caused by:
 - attitudes
 - personality clashes
 - defensiveness
 - other factors tied to emotions

###Obstacles

#####Defensiveness

Symptoms:
 - energy spent on constructing a defense
 - agitation
 - estrangement
 - confusion
 - inclined to strike out

*managers must be aweare of it in themselves*

#####Disconfirmation

Symptoms:
 - attempts to re-establish self-worth
 - feeling put down
 - feeling ineffectual or insignificant
 - self aggrandizement
 - show-off behavior
 - loss of motivation
 - loss of respect
 - withdrawal

###Supportive communication

Requires:
 - congruence (what is communicated matches what the person feels or thinks)
 - descriptive, not evaluative, communication
 - focus on the problem, not the person
 - validation not invalidation of individuals
 - specific and useful, not global

Additional tips:
 - requires change on both sides
 - have patience with pace of change if bad habits were formed over time
 - ensure miscommunication did not occur

#####Congruence
 - manager must not hold back on communicating what is on their minds
   - others will sense the holding back and may mistrust motivation
 - deposits in the 'emotional bank account'
 - trust and respect
 - matching of tone to content and manner
 - does not mean we should blow off steam or not keep anger, etc. under control
 - requires practice because we may not know how to be congruent

#####Incongruence
 - the individual may not be aware of what they are feeling
 - the individual chooses not to communicate how they feel
 - undermines trust

> The greater the congruence of experience, awareness, and communication
> on the part of one individual, the more the ensuing relationship will
> involve a tendency toward reciprocal communication with increasing congruence

#####Evaluative communication
 - places a label on other individuals or their behavior
 - when used, the receiver feels under attack
 - occurs most often when people don't know how to be congruent without being judgemental
 - causes a reciprocal downward spiral

#####Descriptive communication
 - describe objectively your observation of the event that occurred
     or the behavior that needs to be modified
 - what happened, not about the person
 - should be confirmed by another - should not be subjective
 - describe yours or other's reactions to the behavior
 - describe the direct results / consequences of the behavior
 - focus on solutions (not about who is right or wrong)
    - helps the individual save face
 - it is behavior, not the person, that must be modified

> If two people cannot work on the problem together,
> no amount of communication about the consequences of
> poor performance will be productive.

*When the other individual does not communicate well, that 
becomes the focus - you don't abandon the steps of descriptive
communication, you shift the focus*

> Most people want to perform successfully, to be a part
> of a productive and satisfying team, and to be contributors.

#####Problem not person oriented communciation
 - focus on problems and solutions, not on personal traits
 - 'this is the problem' not 'you are the problem'
 - imputing motives is person oriented
 - describing overt behaviors is problem-oriented
 - praise of the individual rather than behavior can be viewed as untrustworthy

#####Validating not invalidating communication
 - validation helps people feel recognized, understood, accepted, and valued
 - invalidation arouses negative feelings about self-worth

What is invalidating communication?:
 - superiority-oriented communication is invalidating
    - put downs
    - use of jagon, acronymns, or words in such a way as to exclude others, create barriers
    - using words the others can't understand
 - rigidity in communication
    - portrayed as absolute / unquestionable
    - people often are this way in order to invalidate other's perspectives
    - never saying 'I don't know'
    - appearing unwilling to tolerate criticisms
    - resistance to personal feedback
 - indifference
 - not acknowledging the feelings or opinions of the other person
    - ignore or make unimportant the personal feelings or thoughts of another

What is validating communication?
 - respectful, egalitarian, helping others feel they are able to help solve problems
    - especially important when there are heirarchical differences 
 - flexibility - willness to communicate acceptance of the possibility there is additional information
 - two-way - individuals are asked questions, allowed to express opinions
 - identifies areas of agreement, positive behaviors, positive consequences, etc first

> To be conscious that you are ignorant is a first great step toward knowledge

#####Specific vs global communication
 - identify something that can be acted upon
 - avoid extremes or absolutes
 - focus on what can be controlled and changed
 - even with complements, specific is better than general

#####Conjunctive vs Disjunctive

> Conjunctive communication confirms the worth of the 
> other person's statements

Conjunctive Communication - joined to previous messages, flows smoothly

Disjuncted Communication - disconnnected from what was stated before

Becomes disjunctive when:
 - lack of equal opportunity to speak
 - talking over one another
 - long pauses in discourse
 - switching topics abruptly by one party

Instead, make sure to:
 - take turns
 - connect what is said
 - don't dominate the conversation
 - avoid long pauses

It helps to:
 - ask questions based on previous statement
 - waiting for the other to finish a sentence
 - say only three to four sentences at a time and 
   give the other party an opportunity to speak

#####Owned vs Disowned

Owned - uses first person words

Disowned - uses pronouns refering to an unknown group, e.g. "We think", "they said", "one might say"

Disowned communication:
 - speaker avoids taking responsibility for what they say
 - conveys disinterest / uncaring
 - implies lack of confidence in the message
 - others can't tell whose point of view the message represents

Ownership of communication:
 - increases self control
 - is key to personal growth
 - people trust the speaker more because they take
   responsibility for what they say
 - indicates willingness to invest in the relationship

Can be used by a manager to help the other person own their own actions

#####Supportive Listening

> In any conversation, the person who talks the most is
> the one who learns the least about the other person.
> The good supervisor therefore must become a good listener

> ... listening skills are often poorest when people
> interact with those closet to them ... they interrupt
> and jump to conclusions (i.e., they stop listening)
> with people close to them than with others.

Bad listening skills happen when:
 - preoccupied with meeting own needs
 - have negative attitudes toward the other person

Show you are listening by:
 - eye contact
 - nods, smiles, focused attention
 - select appropriate responses

Good listeners:
 - choose appropriate response types
 - avoid evaluation and judgement as a first response

Response types:
 - Advising
 - Deflecting
 - Probing
 - Reflecting

#####Advising Responses
 - evaluative
 - provide opinion or instructions
 - creates listener control of the conversation
 - overused by most listeners

problems:
 - creates dependence
 - creates impression of misunderstanding
 - shifts focus from the issue to the listener's advice

avoid:
 - giving advice as a first response

best to:
 - provide advice that is an accepted standard
 - otherwise, should be communicated as opinion

#####Deflecting responses
 - shifts focus away from the communicators' problem to
   one selected by the listener
 - provide similar experience from listener's experience

Appropriate when:
 - comparison or reassurance needed
 - provide needed empathy and support
 - avoid embarrasing either party

Problems:
 - implies that communicator's message is unimportant
 - produces competitiveness

Most effective when:
 - clearly connected to what the communicator just said
 - when the reason for the deflection is clear
 - change in focus validates communicator

#####Probing responses
 - listener asks a question about communicator just said
 - used to acquire additional information or foster appropriate responses
 - helps to avoid evaluative and judgemental responses
 - helps listener be specific and descriptive

Problems
 - sometimes pulls topic away from the issue at hand to the reasons behind it

Hints:
 - prefer what questions to why questions
 - tailor probes to the situation

Probing types:
 - elaboration (tell me more)
 - clarification (what do you mean by...)
 - repition (once again, what do you think about...)
 - reflection (you say you are having difficulty?)

#####Reflecting responses
 - mirror the message to let communicator know it was heard
 - paraphrasing and clarifying the message (not mimicking)
 - should dominate coaching and counseling situations

Problems:
 - communicator can feel they aren't being heard or listened to carefully
 - perceived as an artificial 'technique'

Rules:
 - avoid repeaing the same response over and over
 - avoid mimicking, instead restate
 - make sure to contribute equally to the conversation
 - focus on the personal first
 - respond to feelings before content
 - do not remain detached or over-identify
 - avoid expressing agreement or disagreement
