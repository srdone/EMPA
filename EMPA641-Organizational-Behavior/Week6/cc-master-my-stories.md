#Master My Stories
##How to stay in dialogue when you're angry, scared, or hurt

> Nothing in the world is good or bad, but thinking makes it so

###Two bold claims:
 - Others don't make you mad, you make you mad. You create
   your own emotions
 - Once you've created your emotions, you have to either
   master them or fall hostage to them

###Where our emotions come from
 - We tell ourselves a story, which causes us to feel the emotion
 - This happens because stories help us understand what is going on

###Tips
 - Don't treat your emotions as the only valid response
 - Don't just choke down your reactions
 - Think out your emotions and choose behaviors that create
   better results instead of letting emotions act on you
 - Any set of facts can be used to tell an infinite number of stories
 - By taking control of our stories, they won't take control of us
 - Until we take control of our stories, we can't stop them from taking
   control of us

###How to master our stories
 - Retrace your path
   - Am I in some form of silence or violence?
   - What emotions are encouraging me to act this way?
   - What story is creating these emotions?
   - What evidence do I have to support this story?
 - Notice your behavior
   - recognize the problem, admit it, and take corrective action
 - Get in touch with your feelings
   - Knowing what you are feeling helps you take a more accurate look
     at what is going on and why
   - Willingly talk with loved ones about what's going on inside
   - increase your emotional vocabulary
 - Analyze your stories
   - ask whether you are feeling the right thing and telling yourself
     the right story
   - don't confuse stories with facts
 - Get back to the facts
   - separate fact from story by focusing on behavior
   - watch out for terms that express judgements and attributions
     that create strong emotions
 - Watch out for 'clever' stories
   - victim stories - 'it's not my fault'
   - villian stories - 'it's all your fault'
     - labeling a common divice
   - helpless stories - 'there's nothing else I can do'
   - clever stories do the following:
     - they sometimes match reality
     - they get us off the hook
     - they keep us from acknowledging our own sellouts
 - Tell the rest of the story
   - Am I pretending not to notice my role in the problem?
   - Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person do what this
     person is doing?
   - What do I really want? For me? For others? For the relationship?
   - What would I do right now if I really wanted these results?

> Use your dialogue skills rather than bemoan your weakness
