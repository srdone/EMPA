#Make it safe

###Steps toward making it safe:
 - Ask 'What do I really want?'
 - Clarify your goals to the other person
 - Make sure your intent is pure, that you are not
   judging them or out to harm them
 - Have 'Mutual Purpose' - others perceive that you're
   working toward a common outcome and both of you care
   about each other's goals and interests
 - Watch for signs mutual purpose is at risk
   - debate
   - defensiveness
   - hidden agendas
   - accusations
   - circling back to the same topic
 - Ask yourself:
   - Do others believe I care about their goals in this conversation?
   - Do they trust my motives?
   - Do I really have mutual purpose? 
 - Maintain Mutual Respect
 - Ask yourself:
   - Do others believe I respect them?
 - To keep mutual respect, look for ways we are similar, not different


###Things to avoid:
 - Don't go to silence or violence
 - Don't sugar coat your message by watering down
   or dressing up content
 - Don't play games
 - Make sure you really do have mutual purpose

> Let’s say you’ve got a boss who frequently fails to keep commitments.
> How could you tell the boss you don’t trust him? Surely there’s no way
> to say this without the boss becoming defensive or vengeful, because
> he knows that your goal is merely to make your life better.

> If your only reason for approaching the boss is to get what you want,
> the boss will hear you as critical and selfish—which is what you are.

> The 'sins' of others were different from their own
> more because of the role they played than because of a 
> fundamental blight on their character

###Restoring Mutual Purpose and Mutual Respect
 - Apologize
   - watch to see if this has restored safety
 - Contrast
   - address concerns that you don't respect them
   - confirm your respect or your clarify your purpose
   - constrasting is not apologizing
 - Create a mutual purpose
   - Agree to agree - that is, agree to find a solution that suits
     suits everyone
   - recognize the purpose behind the strategy and see if you can
     find a mutual purpose behind the different strategies
   - where you can't find an immediate mutual purpose, look
     to higher common goals to provide one
   - Brainstorm new strategies that meet everyone's needs

###CRIB
 - Commit to seek Mutual Purpose
 - Recognize the purpose behind the strategy
