#Tolerance and Testimony

 - value of tolerance grew out of 16th and 17th century wars of religion
 - competing claims of tolerance and testimony resolved by larger virtue of love
 - toleration does not exhaust obligation to neighbor
 - love imposes duty to engage others as a believer
 - charity requires us to invest ourselves as believers in our community
 - President Hinckley excellent example
 - his tolerance and testimony flowed naturally from genuine love for God and neighbor
