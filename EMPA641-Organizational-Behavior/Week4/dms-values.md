#Values

Values:
 - foundation of attitudes and personal preferences
 - define our morality and concept of good
 - we are often not aware of our values unless they are challenged
 - affected significantly by the culture and country where we are raised

##Cultural values:
 - universalism (societal rules & norms) vs particularism (relationships)
 - individualism (individual contributions valued) vs collectivism (team contributions valued)
 - affective (showing emotions valued) vs neutral (unemotional responses)
 - specific (segregation of life's roles) vs diffuse (integrating life's roles)
 - achievement (personal accomplishment) vs ascription (inherent attributes, who you know, heritage, who you are)
 - past and present (past tightly connected to future, what you have achieved matters more)
   vs future (future disconnected but valued, where you are headed in the future matters more)
 - internal (individual control, individual invention) vs external (control from outside forces, improvement on what exists)

Important to understand cultural values so we can be sensitive
to them as managers. Also important to understand what the cultural
values of our employer is so we can manage our work relationships
better.

##Personal values
 - All people posess the same values, but emphasize certain ones more than others (?)
 - either personal (peace of mind) or social (world peace)
 - increase in one personal value increases other personal values and 
   decreases social values (and vice-versa)
 - differ in self vs others oriented
 - affect individual behavior
 - means used to achieve end a product of level of values maturity

Terminal values: ends oriented
 - desirable ends or goals for the individual

Instrumental values: means oriented
 - methods for attaining an end
 - morality and competence

Most desired values by employers (in order):
 - responsible
 - honest
 - capable
 - imaginative
 - logical

Least important to managers:
 - obedient
 - clean
 - polite
 - forgiving

##Values maturity
 - people progress
 - priority for values change
 - more mature individuals have qualitatively different
   set of instrumental values
 - people use more than one level of values maturity, but one predominates

3 levels:
 - preconventional (self-centered level)
 - conventional (conformity level)
 - post conventional (principled level)

###Self centered:
 - moral reasoning / instrumental values baed on consequences and personal needs or wants
 - right and wrong judged by outcome for the individual and whether it harmed someone else
 - e.g. stealing $50,000 worse than stealing $500 because consequences for other is worse
 - rules and laws outside themselves, obey to obtain rewards / avoid punishment

###Conformity:
 - based on conforming to / upholding conventions and expectations of society
 - right and wrong based on whether we conform to rules of those in authority
 - stealing 50K vs 500 equally wrong because they violate the law
 - level of most American adults
 - view rules and laws outside themselves, obey to get respect from others

###Principled:
 - most mature level
 - based on internalized principles of the individual
 - comprehensive, covers all contingencies (not dependent on someone else to define - e.g. laws)
 - consistent, never violated
 - universal, does not change in the circumstance
 - stealing 50K vs 500 equally wrong not because of laws, but because of the comprehensive, universal,
   consistent principles developed by the individual
 - examine rules and laws and develop a set of internal principles they believe are morally right - 
   *they obey the principle over the law when they are in conflict*

Milgram's obedience study:
 - principled level individuals refused (75 percent) to cause pain
 - confomity level individuals not so much (12.5 percent)

> The development of [internalized principles to govern behavior]
> is enhanced and values maturity is increased as value-based
> issues are confronted, discussed, and thought about.

> Simply increasing ... communication ... is likely to enhance moral development

##Ethical decision making and values
 - American business has an abysmal track record of late
 - most ethical trade-oggs are conflicts between two desirable ends:
   - economic performance
   - social performance
 - people with a principled level of moral maturity are able to navigate better

###Tests for ethical decision making:
 - how would I feel if this hit the front page news
 - how would I feel if I were treated the same way
 - is the dignity and liberty of others preserved?
 - are the rights of minorities given full consideration?
 - is personal gain potential clouding my judgement?
 - is it consistent with my principles?
 - can the procedures used to make the decision stant up to scrutiny?
 - what is the benefit/cost to others. can the cost be mitigated?
 - will it produce a good night's sleep?
