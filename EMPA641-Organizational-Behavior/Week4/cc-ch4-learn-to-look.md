#Learn to Look

##How to notice when safety is at risk
 - watch both *content* and *conditions*
 - pay attention to why people are going silent
 - respond quickly when you notice you are not in dialogue
 - the longer you wait, the harder and costlier it is to get back on track

##Watch for conditions
 - takes knowledge and practice
 - three conditions:
   - the moment it turns crucial
   - signs that people don't feel safe
   - your style under stress

###Spotting crucial conversations
 - stay alert to:
   - physcial signs (stomach tight, mouth dry)
   - emotional signs (scared, hurt, angry)
   - behavioral signs (raising voice, pointing finger, becoming quiet)

###Learn to look for safety problems
 - when it's safe, you can say anything
 - when you don't fear you're being attached, you can hear anything and not become defensive
 - problem not the content, but the condition
 - silence and violence are signs that people are feeling unsafe
 - when you see silence or violence, be curious

###Silence
 - witholding meaning from the pool
 - masking: understating / selectively showing our true opinions
 - avoiding: steering away from sensitive subjects
 - withdrawing: pulling out of the conversation altogether

###Violence
 - attempting to convince, control, or compel others to your point of view
 - Controlling:
   - cutting others off
   - overstating your facts
   - speaking in absolutes
   - changing subjects
   - using directive questions to control the conversation
 - Labeling:
   - putting labels on people or ideas so we can dismiss them under a general category
 - Attacking:
   - moved from winning, to making the other person suffer

###Your style under stress
 - watch your own behavior
 - become a vigilant self-monitor
 - most often I turn toward masking or avoiding

##Summary
 - learn to look at content and conditions
 - look for when things become crucial
 - learn to watch for safety problems
 - look to see if others are moving toward silence or violence
 - look for outbreaks of your style under stress
