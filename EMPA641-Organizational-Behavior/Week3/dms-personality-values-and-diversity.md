#Key Dimensions of Self Awareness
> Developing self awareness is like exercise,
> it is necessary every day to improve and work on it
> and it can bring about real change in a person

> To thine own self be true, and it must follow as the night
> the day, thou canst not then be false to any man

##Self Awareness
 - heart of ability to master oneself
 - essential to interpersonal functioning
 - essential to understanding and empathizing with others
 - insights linked with real psychic pain
 - essential to improving management skills
 - full self knowledge and honesty with oneself can be painful, but is essential
 - opening up to others helps us to become more self-aware
 - help to diagnose differences among others, which is essential to being a good manager to use their skills
 - recognize our own special gifts and capitalize on our talents

> Hatred against oneself is inseparabel from hatred against others

##The sensitive line
 - the point at which people feel they have to defend themselves
   against information that they feel does not fit with their self-concept

###Threat-rigidity response
 - people tend to become rigid when they feel threatened or uncertainty is created
 - try to protect what is comfortable and familiar
 - self-preservation

###Overcoming the sensitive line limitation:
 - give information that is verifiable, predictable, and controllable
 - This is probably why performance reviews exist
 - having control over when it is received helps
 - confidentiality / trust helps

> Only our reflection in other people shows us what we are like

##Understanding and appreciating individual differences
 - good managers are aware of and empathetic toward individual differences
 - organizations that lack diversity don't allow them to respond appropriately to environmental changes
 - focus on differences, not distinctions (which create barriers)
 - that is, don't place value judgements on individual differences (?)

##Important areas of self awareness
 - emotional intelligence
   - abilty to manage oneself and relationships with others
   - twice as important to excellence as IQ and expertise
 - personal values
   - core of the dynamics of behavior
 - cognitive style
   - the manner we process and gather information
 - orientation toward change
   - how people cope with change - the methods they use
   - how tolerant people are of ambiguity
   - how likely to accept personaly responsibility for their actions
 - core self-evaluation
   - essential aspects of personality

###Emotional intelligence
 - predictive of success in management and work

Intelligence vs Competence
 - intelligence: ability to diagnose, understand, and manage emotional cues
 - competence: noncognitive capabilities and skills that affect human functioning

In this book, definition limited to emotions, not social or interpersonal skills

Definition:
 - ability to diagnose and recognize your own emotions
 - ability to control your own emotions
 - ability to recognize and diagnose the emotions displayed by others
 - ability to respond to those emotional cues

*Emotional intelligence can be enhanced with practice*

####Empathy
 - not sympathyzing or adopting the same feelings
 - understand and connect to other's feelings
 - do not need to experience it themselves to understand it

####Response to emotion in others
 - Match the intensit of the emotions others feel
 - support and encourage emotional expressions
 - don't remain aloof and withdrawn
 - not manipulated by the emotions of others
 - remain in personal control of their responses
 - show that they care for and accept the other person by their emotional responses

*people are smarter now than 100 years ago, but have less emotional intelligence*

###Cognitive Style
How we percieve, interpret, and respond to information
Knowing our cognitive style helps us to:
 - select carrer options
 - identify best work assignments
 - select compatibile teammates
 - improve decision making

2 key dimensions:
 - how you gather information
 - how you evaluate and act on information

Can be altered and changed through practice and conscious development.
*No one is destined to think in a particular way.*
Most people adapt to their circumstances.

####Knowing Style
 - emphasize facts, details, and data
 - excel at problems that have one correct answer

####Planning Style
 - inclined toward structure, preparation and planning
 - prefer organization, do things logically
 - rules as procedures, resistant to change
 - place more importance on theory that is logical rather than practical / utilitarian value

####Creating Style
 - prefer experimentation, nonrational thinking, and creativity
 - impulsive, spontaneous, quick to respond to information
 - tend to be imaginative and emotional

> Cognitive style does not indicate intelligence or capability

##Attitudes toward change
The world is changing rapidly, and managers have to be ready to cope with that change.
Being aware of how we deal with change helps us cope with it.

###Tolerance of Ambiguity
 - can be improved
 - not correlated with intelligence
 - higher abilities => more tolerance of complexity and more flexible

Three subscales:
 - novelty: how tolerant of new, unfamiliar information and situations
 - complexity: the exptend we are tolerant of multiple, disctinctive, or unrelated information
 - insolubility: how tolerant of problems that are difficult to solve

###Locus of Control
The attitude people develop regarding the extent to which they are in
control of their own destinies. *It can be altered.*

Internal vs External
 - I was the cause of success / change vs. something or someone else caused the success/failure
 - in US, internal associated with most effective managers

Internal:
 - be attentive to aspects of the envirionment that provide useful future information
 - engage in actions to improve their environment
 - place greater emphasis on striving for achievement
 - be more inclined to develop their own skills
 - ask more questions
 - remember more information

Benefits of internal:
 - less alienated from the work environment
 - more satisfied with their work
 - experience less job strain
 - more position mobility
 - more likely to be leaders
 - outperform externals in stressful situations
 - engage in more entrepreneurial activity
 - rely on persuasion and expertise as sources of power rather than threats and coercion

*Internal not always a positive attribute*

Benefits of external
 - more inclined to initiate structure - help clarify roles
 - more likely to compliy with directions
 - more accurate in processing feedback
 - less difficulty arriving at decisions with serious consequences for others

###Core Self-Evaluation
Overall positive self-regard
Four components:
 - self esteem
 - self-efficacy
 - neruoticism
 - locus of control

Patterns of traits that form our personality. Much can be learned and changed.

Big Five Attributes:
 - extroversion (outgoing)
 - agreeableness (friendly and affable)
 - consientiousness (careful and organized)
 - neuroticism (emotional fragility)
 - openness (curious and open to new ideas)

High core self-evaluation not the same as people who are self centered,
braggarts, or narcissistic. Those people are selfish people. High 
core self-evaluation implies sensitivity to others and to the environment.

Tend to:
 - select more challenging jobs
 - find the work they are engaged in to be more intrinsicially fulfilling.
 - perform better in their jobs
 - high levels of task motivation
 - high levels of persistence
 - high levels of taol etting
 - high levels of goal commitment
 - high levels of activity
 - high levels of life satisfaction

##Summary
 - self awareness training helps individuals develop empathy and ability to function in diverse settings

#Takaways
 - I can and need to work on overcoming my individual limitations as someone with Asperger's
 - Empathy is not agreeing with the other person, nor is it allowing their emotions to control our actions
 - Empathy can be had without experiencing the same emotion
 - I need to spend more time journaling so I can do better at maintaining my progress
 - I must exercise my self awareness in many more ways than I currently do in order to become more competent
