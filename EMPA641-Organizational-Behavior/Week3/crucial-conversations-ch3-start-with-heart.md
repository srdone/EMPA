#Chapter 3: Start with heart

> Speak when you are angry and you will make the best speech you will ever regret.

The how of dialog:
 - Take a long hard look at yourself
 - Start with heart
 - Lots of practice
 - Have to overcome longstanding habits
 - Others are not the source of all that ails us

> Our problem is not that our behavior degenerates. It's that our motives do.


> ... the best way to work on "us" is to start with "me"


It is about us, in some sense:
 - We are not usually completely innocent
 - We should continually try to improve our dialog skills
 - We must believe that dialogue is always an option
 - When under attack, we begin to worry about winning

When we move away from what our motive should be we:
 - want to win
 - want to punish the other person
 - or we try to ignore the problem and keep the peace

Steps to better dialog:
 - Focus on what you really want
 - 'Talk Turkey' - admit your failings
 - Ask yourself, 'What do I *really* want here?'
 - Refocus your brain - don't let adrenaline do your thinking for you
 - Find your bearings
 - Take charge of your body
 - Refuse the fool's choice

Questions to ask yourself:
 - What do I really want for myself?
 - What do I really want for others?
 - What do I really want for the relationship?
 - What do I really not want?
 - How would I behave if I really wanted these results?
 - How can I behave in order to refuse the fool's choice?

Summary:
 - the only person you can control is yourself
 - pay attention to your motives
 - refuse the fool's choice

###Takeaways
 - Be willing to speak up - to not hide in silence
 - Make sure your motives are pure
 - Don't try to win, to punish, or to ignore the other person
 - Take control of your brain by asking yourself what you want and how you would really behave if you really wanted what you say you want.
