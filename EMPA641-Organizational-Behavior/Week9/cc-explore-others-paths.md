#Explore other's paths

Helping others share their own meaning:
 - listen, be sincere
 - when you ask people to open up, be prepared to listen
 - be curious, find out why the feel unsafe
 - don't overreact to their stories
 - ask: 'Why would a reasonable, rational, and decent person say this'?
 - be patient, wait for emotions to catch up
 - be aware that every sentence has a history that you may not be aware of
 - break the cycle - encourage others to retrace their paths
 - be genuine and listen - help them believe they wont offend or be
   punished for speaking frankly
 - mirror to confirm feelings - describe what you see and hear them saying
 - our tone should say that we are ok with them feeling the way they
   are feeling
 - paraphrase their story to be sur you've understood and let them know that
   you understand
 - don't push too hard
 - ask them what they want
 - prime - pour meaning into the pool to get them to start talking
   - take your best guess at what they are thinking
   - say it in a way that shows it is ok to talk about

Remember your ABCs
 - Agree - don't turn an agreement into an argument
 - Build - point out areas of agreement, then add elements that were
   left out of the discussion
 - Compare - work together to explore and explain differences
