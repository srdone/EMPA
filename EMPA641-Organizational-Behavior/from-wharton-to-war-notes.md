The experience of a Wharton grad in the Marine Corps

> "I can't breathe! I can't breathe!" yelled a fellow Marine Corps recruit
> during our early boot camp training in the tear-gas chamber. The drill
> instructor's response: "I! I! I! What does 'I' have to do with anything?"

> "What are you doing?" I thought, "What am I doing?" Standing on line,
> thinking I'd accomplished something, while my bunkmate struggled.

##"You can't survive in the Marine Corps without helping the guy next to you"

How should we handle, then, issues where people make mistakes because they
don't know the framework, language, libraries, structrue, etc? Work to help
them get better!

> "Nobody, especially a type A Recon Marine, wants to be the person who's
> "not carrying his weight." But some of these guys were simply workhorses
> - they could run forever with this thing - and some of us could not. We
> were learning to put team success ahead of our own egos. That was the only
> way we could move the fastest as a team and win the race. This was a huge change."

I need to have patience with those that can't do what I can in some areas,
and have the humility to accept help from others in other areas.

There should be no one I am unwilling to approach for help or to help.

Good teams have a lot of trust:

> There's a tremendous level of trust required between Marines. But since boot
> camp it's been drilled into all of us to do the right thing. Whether it's good
> for you or not. Whether it's easy or hard. Whether someone is watching or you're alone.

Strong teams have members who move easily between roles

> "The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack"

The best leaders know how to follow

"Two sheets and a blanket"
