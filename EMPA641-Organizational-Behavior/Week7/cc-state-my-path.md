#State My Path
##Communicating Persuasively, Not Abrasively

###being frank yet completely respectful
 - have confidence - be able to say what needs to be said to
   to the person who needs to hear it.
 - have humility - confident you have something to say, but
   realize that others have valuable input as well
 - have skill - if you are good at doing it, it is easier to
   have confidence doing it

###State my path
 - Share your facts
 - tell your story
 - ask for other's paths
 - talk tentatively
 - encourage testing

*first three say what to do, last two say how*

###What to do
 - don't let your stories build up inside you - act on your feelings,
   don't let them act on you
 - Follow your path to action and understand it
 - Use facts
   - Facts are the least controversial - they provide a safe beginning
   - Conclusions are highly controversial
   - Facts are the most persuasive
   - Facts are the least insulting
 - Don't talk in terms of conclusions
 - don't have the goal of persuading others we are right - just add your
   meaning to the pool of shared meaning
 - Don't start with your story
 - Begin your path with facts
 - It takes confidence to share negative conclusions and judgements
 - Don't pile it on (don't wait until you have a ton of negative
   conclusions)
 - Look for safety problems
 - Use Contrasting
 - Ask for others' paths (an mean it)

###How to do it

####Speak Tentatively
 - soften "it's clear to me" to "I'm beginning to wonder if"
 - speak tentatively - and mean it - be open to the possibility
   that you are not right
 - tentative, not wimpy - don't act as if it isn't important

####Encourage Testing
 - invite others to talk
 - invite opposing views - make it clear you want to hear them
 - mean it
 - play devil's advocate when people won't voice their views
 - model disagreeing by disagreeing with your own view
 - do it until your motive becomes obvious

###What to do when you have a strong belief about something
 - don't force your opinions into the pool of meaning
 - this happens when we think we're right and everyone else is wrong
 - ask yourself, how would I behave if these were the results I really
   wanted?
 - Learn to look - are you trying to win? speaking lengthy monologues?
 - tone down your approach, open yourself to the belief that others
   have something important to say
 - recognize that passion can be our enemy
 - it's ok to have strong opinions, we just need to be careful
   how we express them
 - recognize that if you feel indignant or can't figure out why
   others don't buy in, you are in dangerous territory
 - hold on to your belief - but soften your approach
