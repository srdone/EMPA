#Interpersonal Conflict Management

> ... we at Intel believe that it is the essence of corporate health
> to bring a problem out in the open as soon as possible, even if
> it entails a confrontation. Dealing with conflicts lies at the
> heart of managing any business. ... confrontation ... can only
> be avoided at the manager's peril.

> -- Andy Grove, Intel

####Benefits of Conflict
 - more inclusive range of information
 - deeper understanding of the issues
 - more solutions

####When there is no conflict
 - apathy and disengagement
 - climate of complacency
 - leading indicator of being out of touch
   in the marketplace

####Drawbacks of poorly managed conflict
 - saps energy
 - demoralizes
 - dysfunctional outcomes

####Four facts about conflict
 - interpersonal conflict is inevitable
 - conflicts over issues or facts enhance the practice of management
 - although intellectually accepted, most people avoid it
 - we become comfortable with conflict when we know
   how to handle interpersonal disputes effectively

##Effective Conflict Management

> people focused conflicts threaten relationships ...
> issue based conflicts enhance relationships

####Rules of engagment
 - work with more, rather than less, information
 - focus on the facts
 - develop multiple alternatives to enrich the
   level of debate
 - Share commonly agreed upon goals
 - Inject humor into the decision process
 - Maintain a balanced power structure
 - Resolve issues without forcing consensus

####Three essential skills
 - accurately diagnose the types of conflict
 - have an ability to select an effective conflict management strategy
 - be able to solve the conflict and maintain the interpersonal relationships

####Understand conflict types by:
 - understanding what fuels the conflict
 - knowing how it started

####People-focused conflict
 - characterized by accusations of harm, demands for justice,
   and feelings of resentment
 - Nine weeks of management time each year is consumed by people-focused conflict
 - emotional disputes

####Issue-focused conflict
 - like rational negotiations
 - have conflicting priorities, but all recognize the need
   to reach an amicable settlement
 - most successful teams low in people-focused conflict
   but high in issue-focused conflict

##Selecting an appropriate conflict management approach

####Categories of responses to conflict:
 - forcing
 - accomodating
 - avoiding
 - compromising
 - collaborating

####Forcing
 - assertive, uncooperative
 - satisfy own needs at expense of others
 - uses:
   - formal authority (lack of tolerance or self-confidence)
   - physical threats
   - manipulation ploys (egotistical leadership style)
   - ignoring claims of others
 - breeds hostility and resentment

####Accomodating
 - cooperative, unassertive
 - satisfies other party's concerns while neglecting own
 - preserves relationship over confronting issues and protecting rights
 - results in others taking advantage of you

####Avoiding Response
 - uncooperative, unassertive
 - neglects interests of both parties to sidestep conflict
 - happens when managers aren't emotionally prepared for conflit
 - results in:
   - issues not being resolved
   - tough problems avoided
   - subordinates reprimanded when they engage in conflict
     for 'undermining harmony'
 - creates a leadership vacuum, with many people rushing
   in to fill it, creating confusion

####Compromising Response
 - between assertiveness and cooperativeness
 - attempts to obtain partial satisfaction for both parties
 - both parties sacrifice for common goal
 - problems:
   - employees think managers just want to solve
     disputes and not problems
   - encourages gameplaying (asking for twice as much as is needed)
   - undue emphasis on being fair
   - harmony can take priority over value

####Collaborating Approach
 - cooperative, assertive
 - attempts to fully address concerns of both parties
 - find solutions rather than finding fault and assigning blame
 - think win-win
 - encourages trust and assertiveness
 - puts focus on problems rather than personalities

> I can't disagree with them, but it does mean that the best ideas

> on who owns the idea. Pick the best one, and let's go.

> -- Steven P. Jobs, founder of Apple Computer

###Conflict Management and Negotiation Strategies

####Negotiation strategies
 - distributive (dividing a fixed pie - win-lose)
 - integrative (expanding the pie - win-win)
 - all but the collaborating approach are distributive strategies

###When to use which approach to conflict

####We need to:
 - understand our own personal preferences for managing conflict
   - Culture
     - compromise most commonly preferred across cultures
   - Gender
     - little difference among genders for ability and skill in conflict management
     - sex-role affects the part individuals play
     - meaning is different for men vs women
   - Personality
     - altruistic-nurturing (promote harmony and welfare with little concern for reward)
     - assertive-directing (gratification through self-assertion and directing others)
     - *analytic-autonomizing* (gratification through self-reliance, orderliness)
        - attempt to solve problems rationally
        - when conflict intensifies, they withdraw
 - flexibility is important - no one approach is most effective for every type of conflict
 - consider the situation
    - How important is the issue?
    - How important is the relationship?
    - What is the relative level of power between participants?
    - How significant a constraint is time?
 - overcome natural tendencies and use a thoughtful, analytic approach
 - become comfortable using all approaches

####Forcing when:
 - values or policies are at stake
 - superior-subordinate relationship involved
 - close, supportive relationship is not critical
 - there is a sense of urgency

####Accomodating when:
 - relationship is most critical and outweighs all other concerns
 - perceived as only option with subordinates of powerful bosses
 - time and nature of issues not vital to interests and must be solved quickly

####Compromising when:
 - complex and moderately important issues
 - no simple solutions
 - both parties have strong interest in different facets of the problem
 - time to negotiate exists
 - parties have equal power and need a good long-term relationship

####Collaborating when:
 - critical issues
 - supportive, ongoing relationships important
 - time is not pressing
 - participants are peers, not superior-subordinate

####Avoidance when:
 - stake in issue is not high
 - not a strong reason to get involved
 - peer or superior-subordinate
 - severe time constraint exists
