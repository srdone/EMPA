#Motivation

###Work Performance
 - Performance = Ability * Motivation
 - Ability = Aptitude * Training * Resources
 - Motivation = Desire * Commitment

#####Ability
 - native skills and abilities a person brings to the job
 - physical and mental capabilities
 - personality characteristics
 - skills
 - training
 - resources to accomplish tasks

#####Motivation
 - desire to complete the task
 - commitment to a good job

####Diagnosing poor performance
 - How difficult are the tasks being assigned to the individual?
 - How capable is the individual?
 - How hard is the individual trying to succeed at the job?
 - How much improvement is the individual making?

####Ability vs Motivation Problems
 - more pressure in cases of low ability will make the problem worse
   - e.g. when there is lack of resources, training, realistic schedules

####Enhancing Ability
 - Danger signals
   - taking refuge in a specialty
   - focusing on past performance and past successful methods
   - exaggerating aspects of their role
 - Overcoming lack of ability:
   - resupply - personnel, budget, clout (resources)
   - retrain - technical skills quickly become obsolete and people move around
   - refitting - use others to give help in specific areas(?)
   - reassign - fit the employee with a job more in line with their skills
   - release - um... firing
     - avoiding this step in order to protect is often counterproductive

####Enhancing Motivation
 - Theory X: People don't want to work hard and must be intimidated / manipulated
 - Theory Y: People want to do well and just need support
 - Morale programs must focus on increasing satisfaction and productivity
 - refocus on accountability over entitlement (avoid indulging)
 - avoid exploitation of employees (avoid imposing)
 - focus on responsibilities and facts (avoid ignoring)
 - focus on integreating - management should be concerned about employees feeling good *and* good performance

#####Satisfaction vs Performance
 - indulging (low focus on performance, high focus on satisfaction)
 - integrating (high on performance, high on satisfaction)
 - ignoring (low on performance, low on satisfaction)
 - imposing (high on performance, low on satisfaction)

> Somewhere, amid all of my trials, I had begun to trust
> my colleagues *as much as I trusted myself*

Key assumptions about motivation

 - Management should create a supportive, problem-solving work environment
 - Rewards should encourage high personal performance
 - Motivation best when based on self-governance
 - Individuals should be treated fairly
 - Individuals deserve timely, honest feedback

#####Establish Clear Performance Expectations
 - establish clear expectations and then shift to managerial role in enabling achievement
 - *ask what is expected of you and how soon you need to deliver it*
 - Is there agreement on, and acceptance of, performance expectations?
 - groups that set goals have higher performance
 - individuals must 'by into' the goals
 - goals must have resource support or buy-in will not be there

#####Integrative Motivation Program

   3 - Use rewards and discipline
 - Outcomes -> Satisfaction
   4 - provide internal and external incentives
   5 - destribute rewards fairly

#####Appropriate Goals for Motivation
 - specific
 - consistent - can be accomplished along with other existing goals
 - appropriately challenging
   - very important for highly motivated individuals
   - high expectations -> high performance

####Removing obstacles to performance
 - manager's job to make the paths to goals easier to travel
 - manager involvement vary according to:
   - how much subordinates need
   - how much subordinates expect
   - how much support is available from other sources in organization
 - Managers should regularly ask subordinates:
   - how is your work going?
   - what do you enjoy the most/least?
   - how can I help you succeed?

####Reinforcing High Performance Behavior

#####Using rewards as reinforcers
