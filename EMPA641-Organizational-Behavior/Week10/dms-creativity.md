##Approaches to Creativity

#####Four Methods
 - Incubation
 - Imagination
 - Improvement
 - Investment

No one approach is best - different circumstances require different approaches.
See figure 3.2 on p182 to understand relationship between facors affecting which
method is best for a given situation.

#####Imagination: Be New
 - experimentation
 - risk-taking
 - transformational ideas
 - unique visions
 - use when:
   - need brand new, breakthrough products
   - emerging markets
   - resources needed for experimentation

#####Incubation: Be Sustainable
 - teamwork
 - involvement
 - coordination and cohesion
 - building trust
 - empowering people
 - use when:
   - need for collective effort
   - have a diverse community with strong values
   - empowered workforce

#####Improvement: Be Better
 - incremental improvements
 - process control
 - systematic approaches
 - careful methods
 - clarifying problems
 - use when:
   - requirement for quality, safety, and reliability
   - high technical specialization
   - effective standardized processes

#####Investment: Be First
 - rapid goal achievement
 - faster responses than others
 - competitive approaches
 - attack problems directly
 - use when:
   - fast results are a necessity
   - highly competitive environments (?)
   - emphasis on bottom-line outcomes

> Anyone can be creative and add value to problem solving. Just because
> you are not a clever producer of unique ideas, for example, does not
> mean that you are not creative and cannot add value to the creative process

##Conceptual Blocks

Preventers of creativity

#####Conceptual blocks
 - Mental obstacles that constrain the way problems are defined.
 - Some are needed to cope with everyday life - to prevent information overload
 - More formal education and more experience results in less ability to be creative
   - reliance on 'right' and 'proper' ways to solve problems
   - lose ability to experiment, take detours

#####Ways to improve
 - training on improving thinking
 - master the process of thinking about certain problems in a creative way
 - don't place obstacles in the way of risk and exploration
 - provide opportunities for curiousity
 - dont be afraid of new ideas / contradictory ideas
 - expose yourself to lots of ideas

#####Four types:
 - Constancy
 - Commitment
 - Compression
 - Complacency

#####Constancy
 - people like to appear consistent in their approach to life
 - results in defining a problem only one way (vertical thinking) and only 
   using one language to define and assess the problem.
 - Vertical Thinking
   - defining a problem in only one way and never considering other definitions
   - e.g. (lateral thinking) - Bell was trying to design a hearing
     aid and ended up developing a telephone.
 - Single Thinking Language
   - most people think in words
   - break this by thinking in words, symbols, emotions, mental images

#####Commitment
 - when people become settled on a particular view, they don't like to deviate
 - Stereotyping based on past experiences
   - preconceptions based on past experience define how an individual defines
     a situation
   - can help understand the problem but limits ability to think about it
     in new ways
 - ingoring commonalities
   - failure to identify connections across different pieces of information

#####Compression
 - looking too narrowly at a problem
 - screening out too much relevant data
 - making assumptions
 - Artificial Constraints
   - put boundaries around problems that make them impossible to solve
   - assumption that alternative solutions are off limits
   - get around by recognizing hidden assumptions
 - Separating figure from ground
   - inability to solve problems because not enough constraints are in place

#####Complacency
 - fear, ignorance, insecurity, or mental laziness
 - Lack of questioning
   - fear of appearing ignorant for asking questions
   - fear of potential interpersonal conflict resulting from questions
   - socialized to stop asking questions
 - Bias against thinking
   - avoid doing mental work
   - an assumption that if we don't see action, no work is being done
   - bias against thinking based on intuition, synthesis, qualitative judgment
     (so-called "right-hemisphere thinking")

##Overcoming Conceptural Blocks

Like any skill, it requires practice.

Creative problem solvers are less constrained.

#####Steps to being creative
 - gather a lot of information
 - generate a lot of ideas
 - throw the bad ones out

#####Stages of creative problem solving
 - preparation (data gathering)
 - incubation (unconcious mental activity forming connections)
 - illumination (insight is recognized and a solution is described)
 - verification (evaluating the idea)

#####Creative problem solvers
 - less constrained
 - have practice in problem solving
 - have a sense of the appropriateness of a solution

#####Improving the problem definition
 - synectics - form the definition of a problems, then transform it to
   something different that you know more about
   - what does this remind me of?
   - what does this make me feel like?
   - what is it similar/opposite to?
   - when constructing analogies:
     - include action, things that can be visualized, the familiar, relate
       things that are not obviously similar
   - four types of analogies
     - personal analogies (identify themselves as the problem)
     - direct analogies (apply common experience, facts to the problem)
     - symbolic analogies (modeling with math, other symbols)
     - fantasy anaolgies ("wildest dreams" solutions)
 - Elaborate on the definition
   - generate at least two alternative hypothesis for every problem definition
   - SCAMPER (Substitution, Combination, Adaptation, Modification, Putting
     to other uses, Elimination, Rearrangement)
 - Reverse the definition
   - reverse the way you think of the problem
   - "Janusian Thinking" - active formulation of two opposing ideas and
     and supposing them both to be true, then resolving the problem
     - e.g. - Einstein's Relativity
   - point is to contradict the currently accepted definition to expand
     the number of perspectives
