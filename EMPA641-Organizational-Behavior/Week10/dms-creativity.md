##Approaches to Creativity

#####Four Methods
 - Incubation

No one approach is best - different circumstances require different approaches.
See figure 3.2 on p182 to understand relationship between facors affecting which
method is best for a given situation.

#####Imagination: Be New
 - experimentation
 - risk-taking
 - transformational ideas
 - unique visions
 - use when:
   - need brand new, breakthrough products
   - emerging markets
   - resources needed for experimentation

#####Incubation: Be Sustainable
 - teamwork
 - involvement
 - coordination and cohesion
 - building trust
 - empowering people
 - use when:
   - need for collective effort
   - have a diverse community with strong values
   - empowered workforce

#####Improvement: Be Better
 - incremental improvements
 - process control
 - systematic approaches
 - careful methods
 - clarifying problems
 - use when:
   - requirement for quality, safety, and reliability
   - high technical specialization
   - effective standardized processes

#####Investment: Be First
 - rapid goal achievement
 - faster responses than others
 - competitive approaches
 - attack problems directly
 - use when:
   - fast results are a necessity
   - highly competitive environments (?)
   - emphasis on bottom-line outcomes

> Anyone can be creative and add value to problem solving. Just because
> you are not a clever producer of unique ideas, for example, does not
> mean that you are not creative and cannot add value to the creative process

##Conceptual Blocks

Preventers of creativity

#####Conceptual blocks
 - Mental obstacles that constrain the way problems are defined.
 - Some are needed to cope with everyday life - to prevent information overload
 - More formal education and more experience results in less ability to be creative
   - reliance on 'right' and 'proper' ways to solve problems
   - lose ability to experiment, take detours

#####Ways to improve
 - training on improving thinking
 - master the process of thinking about certain problems in a creative way
 - don't place obstacles in the way of risk and exploration
 - provide opportunities for curiousity
 - dont be afraid of new ideas / contradictory ideas
 - expose yourself to lots of ideas

#####Four types:
 - Constancy
 - Commitment
 - Compression
 - Complacency
