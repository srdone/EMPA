####Ways to generate more alternatives

Effecive problem solver have:
 - fluency (number of concepts in a given length of time)
 - flexibility of thought (diverse ideas)

#####Defer Judgement
 - no premature evaluation of ideas
 - wild and divergent ideas encouraged
 - quantity over quality
 - build on ideas of others
 - keep brainstorming even as idea generation slows down

#####Expand Current Alternatives
 - subdivision (divide problem into smaller parts)
 - divide an object into its attributes
 - e.g. divide your life into roles and then list your strengths

#####Combine Unrelated Aottributes
 - morphological synthesis
   - write the problem down
   - list attributes of the problem
   - list alternatives to each attribute
   - combine different alternatives to the attribute list together
 - relational algoithm
   - apply connecting words that force a relationship between two elements
     in a problem
   - e.g. customers among service, service before customers

 - Talk to other people about ideas
 - Ask other people for their suggestions about your problems
 - Read a lot outside your field of expertise
 - Protect yourself from 'idea-killers'

#####Fostering creativity in others

   - provide autonomy and discretion for pursuit of own ideas
   - fluid roles, lots of interaction, flat power structures
 - monitor and prod
   - hold people accountable for outcomes / deadlines
   - mandates that require new approaches to old tasks
     - e.g. - removing the cd drive from Apple laptops
 - reward multiple roles
   - the idea champion (person coming up with creative solutions)
   - sponsor (person who helps provide resources, environment, and
     encouragement for the idea champion to work on his idea)
   - orchestrator (person who facilitates implementation)
   - rule breaker (person who goes beyond organization boundaries to
     ensure success)
