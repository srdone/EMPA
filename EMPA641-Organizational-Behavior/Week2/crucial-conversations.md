#Crucial Conversations

##The power of dialogue

What sets apart good from top performers?
 - the ability to hold crucial conversations well
 - ability to avoid the 'fools choice':
   - 1: speak up and make an enemy
   - 2: suffer in silence and allow a bad choice to be made

Why do we have a hard time?
 - ingrained from young age that we must choose between candor and kindness

Some refuse to make this choice:
 - can be 100% honest and 100% respectful

###Dialogue: the free flow of meaning between people

Why is dialogue needed?
 - differeing opinions, feelings, thoughts
 - need a shared pool of knowledge so everyone understands
   where the other is coming from
 - exposes more accurate and relevant information
 - the larger the shared pool, the better the decisions
 - people more willing to act on collective decision

What prevents dialogue?
 - fear of sharing opinions with powerful people

What happens without dialogue?
 - harder time accepting the information
 - end up quietly criticizing / passively resisting
 - when ideas forced into the pool, people resist passive-agressively
 - move to silence, argue, debate, run away
 - resort to hints, sarcasm, caustic humor, innuendo, looks of disgust

##Learning dialogue
*It CAN be learned!*

##Move to Action

Failure to convert ideas into action because:
 - unclear how decisions will be made
 - poor job of acting on the decisions they do make
 - take forever to make a decision

###Dialogue is not decision making
> The two riskiest times in crucial conversations tend 
> to be at the beginning and at the end. The beginning
> is risky because you have to find a way to create 
> safety or else things go awry

How to make decisions:
 - make line of authority clear
 - when line of authority is not clear, discuss how the decision will be made
 - jointly decide how to decide

Four methods of decision making:
 - command
   - when more involement adds nothing or is not worth it
 - consult
   - decision makers invite input
 - vote
   - when efficiency is needed, and all agree to support the outcome
 - consensus
   - talk until everyone honestly agrees to one decision
   - only use with high-stakes issues / issues where everyone must support the final choice

We must know:
 - Who has an interest in the outcome
 - Who knows information to help with decision
 - who has to agree
 - how many people is it worth involving (keep number low)

Make assignments:
 - Who does what by when
 - follow up
 - be clear in desired outcome 
   - use samples of good / bad
   - dont talk in abstract
 - need clear timeframe

Document your work and hold people accountable
