##Developing teams and teamwork

Learning from geese:
 - V-pattern of geese increases range by 71 percent - similar to drafting (cycling)
 - honk to encourage
 - break ranks to help sick (2 geese)

Effective teams:
 - interdependent members
 - more efficient working together than alone
 - members desire to be members because they see advantages
 - leadership rotates
 - care for and nurture one another
 - members cheer and bolster leader, vice-versa
 - high levels of trust

Teams:
 - participation fun for most people
 - groups of people interdependent in the tasks they perform
 - most desired skill of new employees (p495)

Advantages of teams
 - increases organizational effectivelness

Inhibitors of effective teams:
 - rewarding individuals instead of team
 - not providing autonomy
 - not fostering interdependence
 - failure to orient
 - lack of stability

Problems of teams:
 - insular
 - indecisiveness
 - confusion, conflict, frustration

##Team Development

Stages:
 - Forming
 - Storming
 - Norming
 - Performing

###Forming

Individuals in a common setting
 - who are these people?
 - what is expected of me?
 - who is going to lead?
 - what is supposed to happen?

 - Uncertainty and ambiguity
 - no shared history, no unity
 - seldom willing to query leader
 - most communication toward team leader
 - formal and guarded interaction

Relationships that dominate:
 - silence
 - self-conciousness
 - dependence
 - superficiality

Why?
 - need to know who to trust
 - need to know rules and boundaries

Task issues:
 - orienting
 - establish trust
 - establish relationships with leaders
 - establish clarity of purpose, norms, procedures, expectaitions

Needs:
 - direction
 - clarity
 - structure
 - answer questions
 - get to know

> "We needed each other and we knew it" - Pagonis

###Norming

Teams become highly cohesive and integrated, with pressure to
maintain agreement over all else

Time for developing:
 - team culture and informal relationships
 - common behaviors and perspectives

Members:
 - experience pressure to conform to expectations

Shift from overcoming uncertainty to developing norms

Team members want to know:
 - what are team norms and values
 - how can I get along
 - how can I show support
 - how can I fit in

Changing dynamics:
 - individual needs met through group accomplishment
 - team takes responsibility for solving problems
 - agreement and willingness to go along
 - feelings of loyalty

Interpersonal relationships:
 - cooperative
 - conformity
 - interpersonal attraction
 - ignoring disagreements

Team takes responsibility to:
 - maintain unity and cohesion
 - facilitate participation and empowerment
 - show support for team members
 - provide feedback

Problems if team gets stuck in this stage:
 - groupthink
 - lack of diversity and varied perspectives
 - preservation of team over good problem solving

Groupthink:
 - feeling invulnerable
 - shared stereotypes
 - rationalization of evidence of poor decisions
 - feeling morally invulnerable
 - self-censorship
 - hushing deviant viewpoints
 - guarding against disturbing ideas
 - illusion of unanimity

> To manage [the] tendency to develop groupthink,
> the team must move through the norming stage into
> the storming stage

Addressing groupthink:
 - designated critic / devils advocate
 - encouragement of open discussion
 - subgroups to create independent proposals
 - Invite outside experts/opinions
 - second chance meetings

###Storming

Team members start to have defined roles, increasing the
variety of perspectives, which leads to disagreement

Questions:
 - how will we handle dissension
 - how can we make decisions when there is disagreement
 - how to communicate negative information
 - do I want to remain a member of the team?

> All sunshine makes a desert

Team members begin to:
 - take sides on issues
 - form cliques
 - disagree with the leader
 - challenge views of others

Tasks to address:
 - how to manage conflict
 - legitimize productive individuality
 - create interdependence
 - establish process for consensus building

> Effective leaders encourage contrary opinion, an important source of vitality

Differentiation of roles can encourage cohesion when:
 - target for competition exists
 - recognized as a team for accomplishments
 - maintain visibility of vision
 - turn students into teachers - teach values

> Flexibility can degenerate into chaos in absence of well-established goals

Dissemination of information
 - Learn
 - Apply
 - Teach
 - Inspect

###Performing

Team has overcome:
 - skepticism
 - uncertainty
 - nonparticipativeness
 - dependence
 - self-centeredness
 - groupthink
 - counterdependence
 - conflict
 - polarization
 - disharmony

Team has developed:
 - clear mission
 - personal commitment
 - high loyalty and morale
 - differentiation and variety
 - high mutual trust
 - unconditional commitment to the team
 - *mutual training and development*
 - entrepreneurship
 - willingness of individuals to take responsibility for development of the group

Issues of this stage:
 - how to help members thrive
 - foster continuous improvement / creativity
 - build on competencies
 - maintain energy

Changes:
 - foster continuous improvement

> "I can't quit trying. Once I have experienced excellence, normal performance
> is just not good enough anymore. I can't stand still and expect different results

##Leading Teams

How do we create successful teams?
 - Develop credibility
 - help team members understand how they contribute
 - Be trustworthy and non-hypocritical
 - humility from leader
 - clear and consistent
 - optimistic, complimentary
 - coach team members

Leaders should:
 - demonstrate integrity
 - be clear and consistent
 - stay optimistic
 - focus on commonality first
 - manage agreement and disagreement
 - encourage and coach
 - share information and gather information

##Establishing SMART and Everest Goals

> Leaders who clearly articulate the desired outcomes ... are more likely to
> experience high performance from the team.

Goals should be:
 - specific
 - challenging

###SMART Goals
 - Specific
 - Measureable
 - Aligned (OR Attainable)
   - supports broader goals of org
 - Realistic
 - Time-bound

Goals are not methods

> I never tell a subordinate how to carry out a specific goal

###Everest Goals
 - ultimate achievement
 - beyond the norm outcome
 - achieving it brings inner pride and joy
 - Capture deep inner commitment because the team members care about it
 - Require hard, passionate effort and commitment
 - Depend on complete honesty
 - Motivate learning about oneself
 - Enhance interpersonal relationships
 - Open possibilities

*what are some everest goals for our family?*

> "Full effort is full victory"

> "The process, the experience, the struggle,
> the hard won lessons, these are ends in themselves"

##Team Membership

We spend far more of our time as a team member than a team leader

Team members have a lot of influence on each other

###Member roles
 - Task-facilitating
   - Direction giving, information seeking/giving, elaborating, urging, monitoring,
     process analyzing, reality testing, enforcing, summarizing
   - Necessary for efficient teams
 - relationship-building
   - help maintain a tension-free climate
   - Supporting, harmonizing, tension relieving, confronting bad behavior,
     energizing/motivating, developing (training/coaching), consensus building, emphathizing
 - blocking roles (bad)
   - dominating, overanalyzing, stalling (repeating old arguments), remaining passive,
     overgeneralizing/blowing out of proportion, faultfinding (criticising excessively),
     premature decisions, presenting opinions as facts, rejecting ideas based on the person,
     pulling rank, resisting (negative about all suggestions), deflecting (changing subject)

###Providing Feedback

Fear keeps us from providing needed feedback

Feedback guidelines:
 - focus on behavior rather than the person
 - focus on observations, not inferences / descriptions, not judgements
 - about a specific situation (not past or abstract behavior)
 - share ideas / information rather than giving advice (help individuals identify changes themselves)
 - *don't overload with information*
 - value for receiver, not on emotional release for giver
 - very specific, and at appropriate time and place

Differences may exist across cultures

There is a difference between teamwork and task-aggregation

##Takeaways
 - Effective teams have to be built with concious effort - more that mere task-aggregation
 - Forming, Norming, Storming, Performing are all necessary phases for effective teams
 - Teams need inspiring Everest goals and SMART goals to achieve them
 - Being an effective team member is just as important as being an effective leader
 - Pay attention to problem behaviors and prevent them
 - encourage task-faciliating / relationship building behaviors
 - openness, honesty, and credibility key for effective leaders
