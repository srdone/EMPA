##What Google learned from its quest to build the perfect team

####Two types of teams: Yale class teams and competition teams

Class team:
 - all very similar background
 - jockying for position
 - belittling of others ideas
 - bright and outgoing students
 - one on one easygoing and fun, fraught as a group

Competition team:
 - fun and easygoing
 - very diverse
 - 'could say anything'
 - bright and outgoing students
 - always fun, got along better as a group than as individuals

####Project Aristotle: Using data to figure out how to improve productivity

Teams are the fundabental unit of organization in a company

Questions Google asked:
 - How often teammates socialized outside the office
 - Similar hobbies?
 - Similar educational backgrounds?
 - Outgoing or shy?
 - Overlapping memberships between teams
 - Gender balance of teams
 - Which teams exceeded goals
 - How long teams stuck together

Traits discovered by Google of productive individuals, managers, and teams:
 - Almost impossible to find patterns among individuals - 'who' didn't seem to matter
 - eat with many different people (build larger networks)
 - good communication and avoid micromanaging
 - group norms matter - and override how individuals normally behave

What norms are had in the most productive teams?
 - the right norms raise collective intelligence
 - the wrong norms hobble a team, even if individuals are exceptionally bright
 - as long as everyone got a chance to talk, the team did well
 - high 'average social sensitivity'
 - freeflowing conversation encourages social sensitivity
 - safety - confidence in ability to take interpersonal risk
   - individuals comfortable to be themselves
   - direct and straightforward conversation
   - lack of criticizing
   - joking around, having fun
   - *more than anything else, saftey critical to making a team work*
 - clear goals, dependability
 - clearly understood roles

Team A vs Team B
 - no idle chitchat vs talk about lives
 - lots of experts vs a good mix
 - no discussion vs interjection, lively participation

> Conversely, teams that failed at one thing seemed to fail at everything.

How to implement safety?
 - empathy - be willing to be vulnerable
 - openness and honesty
 - we must know that we can be free to share things that scare us
  without fear of recrimination
   - the problem is, hr actively discourages some of this talk
 - be able to have hard conversations, talk about the messy and the sad

Experience of Sakaguchi
 - be open about struggles - encourages communication
 - team willing to adopt new norms

> my work is my life. I spend the majority of my time working. Most of my friends
> I know through work. If I can’t be open and honest at work, then I’m not really living, am I?’’

> Google ... has perhaps unintentionally demonstrated the usefullness of imperfection

###Takeaways
 - Good managers and teams foster open, honest communication
 - Making it safe to have difficult conversations improves safety
 - Allowing ourselves to be vulnerable allows others to be vulnerable and improves safety
 - Social sensitivity is encouraged by a safe environment
