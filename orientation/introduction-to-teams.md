#Introduction to Teams: Jeff Thompson
##Mindset
 - Growth vs Fixed

seek out challenge / avoid challenge
seek new knowledge / stick to what you know
embrace feedback / avoid feedback
hard wordk = way to grow / hard work = lack talent
work harder after failure / reduce effort after failure
look to talented people for inspiration / compare self to poorer performers

We are here because we want to develop and learn

Switching is all about the internal dialogue

Can help our kids talk in a growth mindset by how we give them feedback.
Complements should be made on their effort, not their talents.
You can do anything you want if you just work hard enough.

Be grateful for feedback and use it to grow. 

##Why Teams?

Challenge us to think better and challenge our assumptions

Gripes
 - freeloader
 - differences in quality expectations
 - dominant personality
 - takes longer
 - martyr 'doing all the work'
 - unclear division of responsibilities
 - naysayers
 - turf wars
 - not good at correcting themselves
 - second guessing

We have teams to get more quality

Dealing with other people is one of the hardest things about being a mortal.

'One heart and one mind' 'Counsel one with another' 'When two or three are gathered in my name'

Apply principles of teamwork in the home

3 promises about teammates:
 - joy in their successes
 - cannot be perfected in public service without them
 - they will change your life

If you refuse to let it change you, then maybe it won't

I can learn to build a strong team

Purpose of life to learn to live with one another, even when it is hard.

Teams are not efficient, they challenge our assumptions

Accountable for the process - make apparent how we are working on that

Four elements of effective teamwork:
 - playing together
 - accountability: team charter with teeth (including dismissing member from a team)
 - 

###Accountability

Team charter with teeth and disciplinary process.

Allow it to help you grow

Building accountability into team charter reduces problems.
