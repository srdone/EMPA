##Orientation

There are people who would have given up everything just to sit where we are sitting.
We must be grateful - so many people who sacrifice so much so we can be here.
Millions of people are paying for my opportunity to be here (families from Guatemala, for example)

Must:
 - Promote and protect the Marriott School brand
 - Don't let the members of the church down
 - Don't let Baudilio down

Every time they make an admissions decision, they pray we will represent the school and
church well.

"We should decide now, in the light of the morning, how we will act when
the darkness of night and when the storms of temptation arrive."

Pressure will come - when there is no pressure, we have no problem making good decisions

Non-negotiables:
 - Prayer
 - Scripture Study
 - Exercise
 - Time with family and friends
 - Temple attendance

"Each of us represents all of us"

BYU First

Three things:
 - Be grateful
 - Be respectful
 - Be brave

###Be grateful
"You who are here are so richly blessed witha great and precious opportunity. Do not waste it" - President Hinckley

Second biggest line item on Church's budget is CES (including BYU)

Moroni's Promise - Moroni 10:3 - be grateful the first part! Being grateful brings the Spirit and softens the heart.

A grateful heart will solve a lot of problems.

"Miracles happen when we have a grateful heart"

###Be respectful

####How we treat our class

Tips:
 - Beware of screens (they drive us apart)
 - Not doing bad is not the same as doing good
 - 2 Nephi 28:21 (All is well...)
 - Time wasters and distractions

Missing Class
 - Choices and consequences
 - Make arrangements in advance
 - "If you pick up one end of the stick, you pick up the other end as well"
 - Some things cannot be arranged

Be Professional

Remember remember why you are here

You did not come for:
 - a diploma
 - a job

We came to be changed, now go and change others

The deal: go out and bless others

'Education is what remains after the information that has been taught has been forgotten'

Its about strengthening our testimonies and helping us prepare to serve others

Value and appreciate differences:
 - country
 - work experience
 - background
 - point of view
 - language
 - gender

Don't cheat yourself of the opportunity to learn from others

Heavenly father has used others a lot more than he has used you

Lessons to be learned among friends - some of the best friends we'll ever have are right here

####How we treat those who work here

Most are here because of their unique mission

Most could be elsewhere at a significant increase in salary

Many are world class

Odds are we aren't seeing everything when we think we see something that can be improved

Two kinds of people: Problem pointers and problem solvers

With a grateful heart, it is hard to be a problem pointer

We are guests here

####Behave

Dress and grooming standards

If we don't look and act the part, we can hurt someone's testimony

'It feels like a temple here'

Don't be the one who says 'not today' - we agreed to abide by the standards

Don't tell me, show me

On display all the time - must be on best behavior all the time

Don't cheat

Just this once - one of Satan's favorite tactics

###Pressure will come

 - Cannot get it all done
 - Life is always busy
 - Prioritize and knock things off the bottom
 - It's not about accounting, OB, etc.
 - Bigger things we are learning

It's not about you!

Be tempted to get caught up in the 'thick of thin things'

Fifteen years to develop a habit and just a week to break it

Decide what you will give up and what you will never do.

###Watch out for each other, it's not about you

Alma 24:17 
Alma 53:14

We will check on one another - keep promises and hold each other accountable

Some days will be harder than others

Some late nights and early mornings - that will never end

Need to work harder than we ever have

The movie ends fine - you are not the exception

The experience will change the trajectory of your life

You can't imagine what it will be like if you are all in

It will be hard - we can make it - we are worth it

Grateful to be here, grateful we are here

Represent them well


###Q&A
